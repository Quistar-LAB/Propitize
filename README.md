Propitize is a mod for Cities Skylines, and is a mod to convert trees to props on the fly. It is integrated with MoveIt mod, so actions can be more convenient. This mod was inspired by Electrix's Tree and Vehicle Mod, and most of the codes are referenced from it.

I created this mod so that trees can be converted to props during runtime, instead of loading all my trees, where I usually only use a few trees in hard to plop situations.

This mod is very ALPHA, and more testing is required.

I welcome anyone to create changes to this mod and improve upon it, as I don't have much time playing the game and programming mods.

Most importantly, have fun playing around with this mod.
