Propitize is a mod for Cities Skylines, and is a mod to convert trees to props on the fly. It is integrated with MoveIt mod, so actions can be more convenient. I didn't write the codes for saving the props yet, so it'll have to come later as I find time.

I created this mod, because Tree and Vehicle prop really didn't help, as it converts all trees, and I really don't use most tree in difficult to plop situations.

This mod is VERY ALPHA, as I'm still learning the nitty gritty of Unity and Colossal Framework. I copied most of the codes from TV prop patch mod, so thanks for publicising the codes helping me create this mod.

I welcome anyone to create changes to this mod and improve upon it, as I don't have much time playing the game and programming mods.

Most importantly, have fun playing around with this mod.
